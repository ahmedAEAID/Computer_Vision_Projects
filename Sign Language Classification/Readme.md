## Project Describtion:

- This project involves building a deep learning model for classifying sign language gestures. The model is trained on a dataset of images of sign language gestures, where each image belongs to one of several classes corresponding to different letters of the alphabet. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify new images of sign language gestures.

- The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. The data is preprocessed by resizing the images and normalizing the pixel values. The model is built using a CNN architecture, and is trained on the preprocessed data using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. The training process is monitored using several metrics, including loss, accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and AUC. The model is evaluated on a test set of images, and the performance is measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix. Finally, the model's predictions are visualized using a series of sample images.
